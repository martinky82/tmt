summary: Test framework defining how tests should be executed

story:
    As a tester I want to include tests using different test
    execution framework in a single plan.

description: |
    The framework defines how test code should be executed and how
    test results should be interpreted (e.g. checking exit code of
    a shell test versus checking beakerlib test results file). It
    also determines possible additional required packages to be
    installed on the test environment.

    Currently ``shell`` and ``beakerlib`` are supported. Each
    `execute` step plugin should list which frameworks it supports
    and raise an error when an unsupported framework is detected.

    Should be a ``string``, by default ``shell`` is used.

example: |
    framework: shell

    framework: beakerlib

implemented: /tmt/base

summary: Filter tests relevant for given environment

story:
    As a tester I want to skip execution of a particular test case
    in given test environment.

description: |
    Sometimes a test is only relevant for specific environment.
    Test Case Relevancy allows to filter irrelevant tests out.

    .. warning::
        Test Case Relevancy has been obsoleted. Use the new
        :ref:`/spec/core/adjust` attribute instead to modify test
        metadata for given :ref:`/spec/context`.

example: |
    summary: Test for the new feature
    adjust:
        enabled: false
        when: distro ~< fedora-33
